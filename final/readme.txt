The world as we know it lies in the hands of the Elder Races. In the Battle of the Dawn, the brave warriors of Elves,
Humans, and Mages, face the hordes of Skeletons and Orcs to put the end to the final battle between the Good and the
Evil. Many will have to sacrifice themselves for the Greater Good. If they succeed, they will bring peace and prosperity
to the Lands of the Eleteh.
